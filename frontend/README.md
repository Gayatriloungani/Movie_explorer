In my MOVIE EXPLORER,
TECH STACKS used are HTML/CSS, REACT.JS

In my website there is search functionality, using which we can search movie within 3 sec (time set by me) all the movie with the name searched will come and after clicking on the movie image we redirect to page where we found the release date of the movie , its genre , rating out of 10 , country in which it is made.
In the same page we have GO BACK button which again redirect us to the home page.
